# 🌤️ CS690 Final Project – MoodLogger

This project is a wellness tracking console application designed to help users like **Emma** understand how various daily factors — such as **mood**, **sleep**, **diet**, **activities**, and **weather** — influence their emotional well-being over time.

## 📖 Scenario: *"A Day in the Life of Emma"*

Emma wakes up tired and irritable, unsure whether it’s lack of sleep or skipping a workout. Throughout the day, she wonders if her mood could be tied to things like what she eats, the weather, or how active she is. Inspired by a coworker’s suggestion and a blog post on wellness tracking, Emma decides it’s time to find patterns in her lifestyle. But doing it all manually feels overwhelming — she needs a simple, consistent way to log her daily experience.

That’s where this app comes in.

## 🎯 Business Requirement

> Develop a console-based C# application using .NET 8 that enables users to track and review lifestyle-related data (mood, sleep, food, activities, and weather) with the goal of identifying patterns that affect emotional health.

## ✅ Use Cases

### 🥗 UC1: Food Logging  
Emma records her daily food intake to observe how her dietary habits influence mood and energy levels.

### 🛌 UC2: Sleep Logging  
Emma logs how many hours she slept the night before to evaluate how sleep correlates with emotional stability.

### 🏃 UC3: Activity Logging  
Emma notes key activities like workouts, junk food, or screen time that could impact her mental state.

### 🌧️ UC4: Weather Logging  
Emma tracks environmental conditions (sun, rain, etc.) to explore how weather may affect her mood.

### 📈 UC5: Mood Logging & Trends  
Emma logs her mood and later reviews trends like:  
- **Sleep vs. Mood**  
- **Sunny Days vs. Mood**  
- **Activity vs. Mood**
